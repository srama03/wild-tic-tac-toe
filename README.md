## Wild Tic-Tac-Toe: Minimax Algorithm Modification

### Introduction

This project explores a customized version of Tic-Tac-Toe with unconventional rules: achieving three symbols in a row results in a loss instead of a win. This twist challenges traditional strategies and requires a fundamental rethinking of AI logic for the game. By modifying the minimax algorithm and redesigning the evaluation function, this project demonstrates how AI can adapt to unique rule sets.

### Objective
The goal is to build an AI capable of playing this custom version of Tic-Tac-Toe effectively by:

* Modifying the minimax algorithm to account for loss conditions.
* Developing and testing a custom evaluation function.
* Validating AI performance against both deterministic and random opponents.
  
### Key Features
* Adapted the minimax algorithm to unconventional game rules.
* Designed a custom evaluation function to avoid loss conditions.
* Conducted extensive testing to ensure AI robustness.
  
### Tech Stack
* Python
